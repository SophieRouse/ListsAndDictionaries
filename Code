# This code is using dictionaries to calculate how much a cafe's total stock is worth.
# Menu items were put into a list, then dictionaries were used to determn Key-value pairs for stock numbers and prices of each menu item.
# An equation was then used to work out each item value and these were added together to get the total value.
# The total value was then printed.
