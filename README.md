# Lists And Dictionaries
Python task completed on Dictionaries and lists for the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp

This project uses lists and dictionaries to calculate the total amount of money the cafe could earn from their stock levels.
A list is used to show all of the items on a cafe's menu. The first dictionary is used to show how many of each item the cafe has in stock.
The second dictionary is used to pair a price to each menu item.
A calculation is then used to calculate the value of each menu item they have in stock and then calculate the sum of all menu items to give the total value of the cafe's stock.

This project allows cafe owners to keep an eye on the value of the stock. I plan to adapt the code to allow cafe owners to check their stock levels and use the code to calculate how much they have earned each day.
